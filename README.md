# Job Portal (React + Tailwind + Supabase + Clerk + shadcn/ui)

A modern **Job Portal** built using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Supabase**, **Clerk Authentication**, and **shadcn/ui**.

This project connects job seekers with recruiters — allowing them to register, view job listings, and apply for positions.  
It also serves as a **learning project** to understand **Supabase (Backend-as-a-Service)** and **PostgreSQL (SQL database)** from scratch.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js** — UI library
- **Tailwind CSS** — modern styling
- **shadcn/ui** — prebuilt, accessible UI components
- **Clerk** — authentication (email, Google, etc.)
- **Supabase** — backend (database, APIs, auth)
- **PostgreSQL** — relational database used by Supabase

## Notes

As part of this project, I’m also documenting my learning journey with key technologies used here.

### 📘 Supabase Crash Course
Inside the folder [`Supabase-crash-course/`](./Supabase-crash-course/supabse.mds), you'll find detailed notes about **Supabase** including:
- What Supabase is  
- What it provides  
- Why we use it in React projects  
- Basic **PostgreSQL + SQL query** examples and integration steps

These notes serve as a **quick reference guide** for myself and anyone who wants to understand how Supabase works alongside React + Tailwind + Clerk + shadcn/ui.
