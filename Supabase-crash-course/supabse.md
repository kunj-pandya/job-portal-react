## 🚀 What is Supabase?

**Supabase** is an **open-source Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)** platform that gives you everything you need to build modern apps — without writing a custom backend.

It’s built on top of **PostgreSQL**, a powerful open-source database.

🔹 Supabase provides:
- **Database (PostgreSQL)**
- **Auto-generated APIs**
- **Authentication (email, Google, etc.)**
- **Storage for files**
- **Real-time data updates**
- **Edge Functions** (for server logic)

## 🧩 Why Use Supabase?

| Feature   | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| Database  | Uses PostgreSQL — a relational SQL database |
| APIs      | Instantly generated for every table you create |
| Auth      | Handles login/signup (email, OAuth, etc.) |
| Storage   | Upload and serve files |
| Real-time | Subscribe to data changes (e.g., chat apps) |
| Functions | Run server-side code securely |

## ❓ How It Works?

Your React app communicates with Supabase using **JavaScript SDK**, not SQL directly.  
But knowing a little SQL helps you understand what’s happening behind the scenes.
